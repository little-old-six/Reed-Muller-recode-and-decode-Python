# Reed-Muller Codes in Python

**Status:** Under update, version 1.0

This is a research project I completed for a course at Sun Yat-Sen University, "Information Theory and Coding."

This work attempts to present the encoding and recoding of Reed-Muller codes in different ways, 
and includes a Python implementation of encoding and decoding using Reed-Muller codes.

In the recoding program, it not only includes the conventional method of generating the feature matrix, 
but also has the Recursive definition of matrix method.

Furthermore, in this project, the first-order Reed-Muller codes, which is that R=1, is decoded by the Hardmand matrix and Kronecker Product decoding method. 
About the multi-order Reed-Muller codes, i.e., R>1, they are decoded with Majority Logic method.

Code now works on Python 3.6 and even higher versions.

**Addition:** For more details about majority logic decoding, you can read the 
research report of Pro.Raaphorst. By the way, the report is also in the program file.
